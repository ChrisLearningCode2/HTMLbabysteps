# HTMLbabysteps
# Once upon a time, I taught my self some markup, static HTML. Had no glue what CSS even was. 2024 I decided to reignite that passion. Its static, ugly and I am still in awe I still knew some HTML.

   <p>How-it-began</p>
    <h1>The Beginning started with HTML </h1>
        <h2>What will follow is everything surrounding it.</h2>

    
        <p>
            <em>Just a few weeks ago</em> my life was turned upside down. My last dog passed away.<br>
 
            This was the first time in about 19 years I had spare time on my hands.
            I began thinking: what can I do in that time? What would help me to get over the fact my routine has changed?
            That wenn I started dappeling with small raspberry pi servers, adjusting my privacy online and fortifing my network.
            I then got to a point, that I wanted somewhere to post my growth. Personal blog, just for me.
            After using Substack for other projects, "why not make a personal blog from scratch" came into my head.
            <p> 
                <h3>So it began.</h3>
                <p>
                I gathered some books, looked through the web and hesitently started with HTML-tutorials. 
                Thats when again, life through a curve ball that hit me straight in the face: my parents had fallen gravely ill. <br>
                  And their clock has speed up. I knew I will have to go home very soon.
                <p>Home, in this case is a completly differnet country. <br>
                  At the moment I am located in Germany, have a flat and a job. I live a small life but compfortable one.</p>

             

                <p>
                    <h3>How will I do this without losing everything I have built?</h3> 
                    <p>Well a job would ease the relocation. <br>
                      I cannot keep mine, as my company doesn`t do remote gloably not even if the headquarters are in the new country. <br>
                      Ok, then I will speed up what I have begun, become at least user sufficiant and<br> this can polish my skills in any job application plus<br>
                      it widens the areas I can apply to. <br>Being 52 years old, is a real obsticle when competing with younger workers that probaly have skills from collage, <br>
                      rather then books and online courses.
                <p>So here I go, a new goal a new adventure. 
                    <strong>The journay may have began with curiosity, but now it might be a life line.</strong>  </p>
